# BIOB480 / BIOE548: Conservation Genetics

This [GitHub repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories) is home to the data and code for 
end-of-semester projects in BIOB480 / BIOE548 in the Department of Ecology at Montana State University. Students will work in groups of 3-5 to analyze 
empirical genetic or genomic data from a population of wild plants or animals. Specifically, each group will select a published dataset and population 
genetic metric, read the associated scientific article, learn how genetic data are formatted, load the data into R, and perform simple analyses. All groups 
will present their work during the final two class periods.
